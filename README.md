# Programs Repository

This repository contains my basic **C and C++ programs**.  
Each folder includes small practice problems like:
- Switch case
- If-Else
- Loops
- Arrays
- Functions
- Series Sum
- Triplets
- Binary, etc.

## How to Run
- Compile using `gcc filename.c` or `g++ filename.cpp`
- Run the output file (`./a.exe` on Windows, `./a.out` on Linux/Mac)

## Notes
- Source files only (`.c`, `.cpp`) are uploaded.
- Executable files (`.exe`, `.class`) are ignored using `.gitignore`.
